*Is statistics anxiety a construct distinct from maths anxiety?*

A multi-phase, multi-analysis project using novel approaches to examine whether statistics anxiety is distinct from maths anxiety (phase one) and whether measurement tools are responsible for any differences (phase two). Phase three will test cross-validation and replication of findings in non-weird samples.

**Pre-registration coming soon!**
