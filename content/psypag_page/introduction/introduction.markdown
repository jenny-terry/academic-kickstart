I am the [PsyPAG](http://www.psypag.co.uk/) representative for the Mathematical, Statistical, & Computing Section of the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk) for the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years.

I would love to hear about the experiences of postgraduates either specialising in or in any way using maths, statistics, or computing in your degrees so please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) with your comments and questions.
