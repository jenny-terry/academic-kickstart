I am the [PsyPAG](http://www.psypag.co.uk/) representative for the Mathematical, Statistical, & Computing Section of the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk) for the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years.

To give some insight into why I applied for this position and what my current priorities are, below are the questions and responses from my application.

Really, however, I want to hear from current postgraduates about your experiences so please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) with your comments and questions.

### What issues do you think are important for postgraduate psychologists who would be represented by your position/division?

Psychology is experiencing renewed interest in improving quantitative methods, but much work remains. Reforms have largely developed from grassroots movements but without top-down support, awareness is somewhat siloed and postgraduates face risks and uncertainty. To address these problems, postgraduates need:

* Widespread, equal access to training in the critiques of and new approaches to quantitative psychology
* Clear guidelines and support to assist navigation of competing narratives about the costs and benefits of statistical and methodological reforms
* Promotion of a culture that better understands, values, and integrates the contributions of mathematical, computational, and other methods-focused work to substantive research

### What relevant experience do you have in representing the views of students or other groups and why do you want to be a PsyPAG rep?

Whilst President of my undergraduate Psychology Society, I led a campaign that petitioned stakeholders to help us establish a peer-led mental health course for students, addressing the poor availability of both support and work experience. I represented the views of students and, moreover, acted upon them to deliver lasting positive change.

I would now like to bring this energy to this committee position. I want to work with postgraduates to generate a contemporary understanding of the challenges they face regarding quantitative methods and reform, and work towards solutions that widen engagement, develop skills, facilitate collaborations, and ultimately improve psychological research.
