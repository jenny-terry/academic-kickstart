The Researchers of Statistics Education (RoSE) Network is an informal group for researchers that are studying (or interested in studying) topics related to the teaching, learning, & application of statistics and research methods in our discipline.

Examples of our members' research interests include statistics pedagogy, the understanding and application of statistical concepts and tools, the role of attitudes and emotions on statistical comprehension, and the measures and methods used to research statistics education.

We offer an online space (Slack) to connect with others with similar research interests. Through this, several research collaborations have already been established and, as we look to grow, the group will begin running virtual lab meetings and other events.

If you'd like to join or have any questions, please [contact me](#contact).
