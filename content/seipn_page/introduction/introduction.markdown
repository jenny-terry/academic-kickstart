The RoSE network is an informal group of PhD students that are researching statistics education in psychology. The topics we're studying include pedagogy, how students learn, application of knowledge, emotions, and the way that statistics education is researched.

As well as offering a space to connect with others with similar interests, we are excited to have begun planning our first collaborations (with the caveat that the PhD comes first!).

We met in 2019 through our in-person and online networks so are newly formed and still quite small and are always on the look out for new members so please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) or add yourself to our fledgling [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/189452378814964/?ref=bookmarks), if you might like to join us.
