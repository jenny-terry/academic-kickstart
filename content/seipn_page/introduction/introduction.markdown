The RoSE network is an informal group for PhD students that are researching statistics education in psychology. Between us, we study a broad range of topics including statistics pedagogy, how students learn statistics, the application of statistical knowledge, the impact of emotions on statistical comprehension, and the measures and methods used to research statistics education.

As well as offering a space to connect with others researching similar topics, we are excited to have begun planning our first collaborative projects (watch this space!).

We met in 2019 through our in-person and online networks so are newly formed and still quite small and are always on the look out for new members. Please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) or add yourself to our fledgling [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/189452378814964/?ref=bookmarks) if you'd like to join or find out more.
