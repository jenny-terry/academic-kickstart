The RoSE network is an informal group of PhD students that are researching statistics education in psychology. Within that remit, we study a broad range of topics, including statistics pedagogy, how students learn statistics, application of statistical knowledge, the impact of emotions on statistical comprehension, and the measures and methods used to research statistics education.

As well as offering a space to connect with others with similar interests, we are excited to have begun planning our first collaborative projects.

We met in 2019 through our in-person and online networks so are newly formed and still quite small and are always on the look out for new members so please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) or add yourself to our fledgling [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/189452378814964/?ref=bookmarks) if you might like to join us.
