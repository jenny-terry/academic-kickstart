## PhD Projects (Empirical)

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> The Many Anxieties Project: A Multi-Site, Multi-Study Investigation of the Convergent & Discriminant Validity of Statistics and Maths Anxieties </span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Terry, J., Field, A. P., et al. (In Progress)</span>

Recent research indicated that statistics anxiety and maths anxiety are unlikely to be separate constructs (Terry & Field, 2021). This project will examine whether these findings conceptually replicate in a large, international sample and whether the construct underlying statistics anxiety and maths anxiety is itself unique or whether it can be attributed to a more general anxiety construct.

Approximately 100,000 undergraduate students in ~150 universities in ~45 countries that have taken or are taking statistics as part of an otherwise non-maths based degree will be invited to take part in an online self-report questionnaire study. The survey contains measures of statistics anxiety, maths anxiety, and a series of other constructs that may be underlying or are theoretically related to statistics and maths anxieties. We will also be collecting maths and statistics achievement data and information about the students' statistics courses. A series of psychometric analyses will be conducted to examine our core research questions.

A secondary aim of this project is the curation of a large open dataset to facilitate study into other related research questions.

Maths anxiety and statistics anxiety are currently treated as separate constructs in the research literature, yet few studies have examined their distinctiveness. This study tested the distinctiveness of the two constructs using exploratory factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and a between-subjects experimental procedure in a sample of 465 psychology undergraduates. Results indicated that the two constructs mostly likely share an underlying construct and this could not be attributed to the differences in the measurement scales themselves.
