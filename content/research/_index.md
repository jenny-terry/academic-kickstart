### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> Data from an International Multi-Centre Study of Statistics and Mathematics Anxieties and Related Variables in University Students (the SMARVUS Dataset) </span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Terry, J., Ross, R. M., Nagy, T., … Field, A. P. (2022)</span>

This large, international dataset contains survey responses from N = 12,570 students from 100 universities in 35 countries, collected in 21 languages. We measured anxieties (statistics, mathematics, test, trait, social interaction, performance, creativity, intolerance of uncertainty, and fear of negative evaluation), self-efficacy, persistence, and the cognitive reflection test, and collected demographics, previous mathematics grades, self-reported and official statistics grades, and statistics module details. Data reuse potential is broad, including testing links between anxieties and statistics/mathematics education factors, and examining instruments’ psychometric properties across different languages and contexts. Data and metadata are stored on the Open Science Framework website: [https://osf.io/mhg94/](https://osf.io/mhg94/).

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> UK Psychology PhD Researchers' Knowledge, Perceptions, and Experiences of Open Science</span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Pownall, M., Terry, J., Collins, E., Sladekova, M., & Jones, A. R. R. (2022)</span>

To advance the goals and values of open science, it is vital that the next generation of researchers, i.e., PhD researchers, are supported in adopting open science practices. However, to date, there is no comprehensive understanding of psychology PhD researchers’ knowledge, perceptions, and experiences with open science in a UK context. The present study used a pre-registered mixed methods design to fill this gap in the literature, by surveying psychology PhD students in the UK (n= 196) on their experiences with open science, perceptions of open science, and knowledge of open science tools and practices. Our findings demonstrate that while attitudes towards questionable research practices were consistently high, knowledge and perceptions of open science tools and practices varied considerably across PhD researchers. In particular, supervisory support and guidance with open science practices was mixed across participants. Perceived benefits of engaging with open science included benefits to employability, signalling researcher credibility, sharing learning and resources, building collaboration and relationships, and wider dissemination of PhD researchers’ work. Perceived barriers included lack of time, financial reasons, fear of scooping, fear of judgement or criticism, and incompatibility with research paradigms (e.g., qualitative research). Implications for policy, including British Psychological Society training and support, are discussed.

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> The impact of open and reproducible scholarship on students' scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes towards science: A review and synthesis of the evidence</span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Pownall, M., Azevedo, F., König, L. M., Slack, H., Rhys Evans, T., Flack, Z., … Terry, J., … & Sadhwanai, S. (2022)</span>

In recent years, the scientific community has called for improvements in the credibility, robustness, and reproducibility of research, characterized by higher standards of scientific evidence, increased interest in open practices, and promotion of transparency. While progress has been positive, there is a lack of consideration about how this approach can be embedded into undergraduate and postgraduate research training. Currently, the impact of integrating an open and reproducible approach into the curriculum on student outcomes is not well articulated in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we provide the first comprehensive review of how integrating open and reproducible scholarship into teaching and learning may impact students, using a large-scale, collaborative, team-science approach. Our review highlighted how embedding open and reproducible scholarship may impact: (1) students’ scientific literacies (i.e., students’ understanding of open research, consumption of science, and the development of transferable skills); (2) student engagement (i.e., motivation and engagement with learning, collaboration, and engagement in open research), and (3) students’ attitudes towards science (i.e., trust in science and confidence in research findings). Our review also identified a need for more robust and rigorous methods within evaluations of teaching practice. We discuss implications for teaching and learning scholarship in this area.

## Manuscripts in Preparation

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> Statistics Anxiety and Maths Anxiety: Evidence of Jangle Fallacy</span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Terry, J., Lea, C., & Field, A. P. (Manuscript in Preparation)</span>

Maths anxiety and statistics anxiety are currently treated as separate constructs in the research literature, yet few studies have examined their distinctiveness. This study tested the distinctiveness of the two constructs using exploratory factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and a between-subjects experimental procedure in a sample of 465 psychology undergraduates. Results indicated that the two constructs mostly likely share an underlying construct and this could not be attributed to the differences in the measurement scales themselves.
