summary: "It is important to understand whether maths anxiety, statistics anxiety, and other related constructs are distinct to prevent siloed research literatures that can impede scientific progress. Maths anxiety and statistics anxiety are currently treated as separate constructs in the research literature, yet no informative studies have been conducted that examine their distinctiveness. The present study tested the distinctiveness of the two constructs using exploratory factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and experimental work in a sample of 465 psychology undergraduates. Results indicated that the two constructs mostly likely share an underlying construct."
