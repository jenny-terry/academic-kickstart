abstract: "To advance the goals and values of open science, it is vital that the next generation of researchers, i.e. PhD researchers, is supported in adopting open science practices. However, to date, there is no comprehensive understanding of psychology PhD researchers’ knowledge, perceptions, and experiences with open science in a UK context. The present study used a pre-registered mixed methods design to fill this gap in the literature, by surveying psychology PhD students in the UK (n = 196) on their experiences with open science, perceptions of open science, and knowledge of open science tools and practices. Our findings demonstrate that while attitudes towards questionable research practices were consistently high, knowledge and perceptions of open science tools and practices varied considerably across PhD researchers. In particular, supervisory support and guidance with open science practices was mixed across participants. Perceived benefits of engaging with open science included benefits to employability, signalling researcher credibility, sharing learning and resources, building collaboration and relationships, and wider dissemination of PhD researchers’ work. Perceived barriers included lack of time, financial reasons, fear of scooping, fear of judgement or criticism, and incompatibility with research paradigms (e.g. qualitative research). Implications for policy, including British Psychological Society training and support, are discussed."
