The Researchers of Statistics Education (RoSE) in Psychology Network is an informal group for PhD students that are studying (or interested in studying) topics related to the teaching, learning, & application of statistics and quantitative methods in our discipline.

Our members' PhDs cover statistics pedagogy, understanding & application of statistical concepts and tools, the impact of emotions on statistical comprehension, and the measures and methods used to research statistics education.

As well as offering a space to connect with others with similar research interests, we are excited to have begun planning our first collaborative research projects (watch this space!).

We met in 2019 through our in-person and online networks and are always on the look out for new members. If you'd like to join or have any questions, please do feel free to [contact me](#contact) or add yourself to our fledgling [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/189452378814964/?ref=bookmarks).
