## PhD Projects (Empirical)

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> The Convergent & Discriminant Validity of Statistics Anxiety and Maths Anxiety: A Multi-Site, Multi-Study Project</span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Terry, J., Field, A. P., et al. (In Progress)</span>

Recent research has indicated that statistics anxiety and maths anxiety are unlikely to be separate constructs. The proposed project will examine whether these findings (conceptually) replicate in an large, international sample and whether the construct underlying statistics anxiety and maths anxiety is itself unique, or whether it can be attributed to a more general anxiety construct. 

Approximately 100,000 students in ~155 universities in ~46 countries that have taken or are taking statistics as part of an otherwise non-maths based degree will be invited to take part in an online study. The survey contains measures of statistics anxiety, maths anxiety, and a series of other constructs that may be underlying or are theoretically related to statistics anxiety and maths anxiety. We will also be collecting data from research partners about the statistics courses that the students have/are taking and collecting student grades for those courses. This data will be subjected to a series of psychometric analyses to examine our core research question.

A secondary aim of this project is the curation of a large open dataset to facilitate study into other research questions.

Maths anxiety and statistics anxiety are currently treated as separate constructs in the research literature, yet few studies have examined their distinctiveness. The present study tested the distinctiveness of the two constructs using exploratory factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and a between-subjects experimental procedure in a sample of 465 psychology undergraduates. Results indicated that the two constructs mostly likely share an underlying construct that could not be attributed to the differences in the measurement scales themselves.

## Other Projects

### <span style = "color:#e770a1"> PhD Psychology Students' Perceptions, Understandings, and Experiences of Open Science</span>

<span style = "color:#e770a1"> Collins, L., Terry, J., Pownall, M., Sladekova, M., * Jones, A. (In Progress)</span>

The Open Science movement in Psychology is becoming ubiquitous. The reforms call for new practices, attitudes, skills, and understandings, and yet we know very little about the influence and impact upon postgraduate research students. This study uses a mixed-methods survey-based approach to examine UK PhD Psychology students' perceptions, understandings, and experience of Open Science.
