Jenny Terry is currently a Doctoral Researcher and Doctoral Tutor in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex. She also teaches research methods and statistics at the University of Brighton and is the PsyPAG representative for the British Psychological Society's Mathematical, Statistical, and Computing Psychology section.

Jenny predominantly uses quantitative methods to explore the impact of emotions and attitudes upon achievement in higher education, particularly on introductory statistics courses in psychology. Her PhD combines these substantive interests with an enthusiasm for improving methods in psychology by focusing on theory and measurement in statistics anxiety research - is it a unique construct and what are the subsequent implications?

Alongside the PhD, Jenny is also involved with projects exploring the teaching and learning of R/RStudio, postgraduate researchers' experiences of doing open science, and whether introducing statistics to students as an anxiety-inducing subject itself induces anxiety.

Jenny is a PGCert-qualified HEA Fellow with experience lecturing, running seminars, supporting workshops, and co-supervising dissertations for undergraduates as well as developing and running workshops for staff and PGRs. Topics taught include statistics (with R/RStudio and SPSS), quantitiave and qualitative research methods, social psychology, and cognitive psychology. Jenny endeavours to make learning inclusive, enjoyable, and stimulating for a range of abilities.

Jenny's administrative experience includes institutional-level research lead for a ~Â£500K OfS-funded project, organising an informal network for PhD researchers of statistics education in psychology, and supervision of a peer-learning scheme.
