Jenny Terry (she/her) is a Lecturer in Psychological Methods and Doctoral Researcher in the [School of Psychology](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) at the University of Sussex.

Jenny began teaching research methods and statistics at the undergraduate level in 2017-18 and began teaching R in 2018-19. She now co-convenes the first statistics module at Sussex, upon which she is responsible for introducing students to R and the module's new peer-learning scheme. She has also recently lead teaching in Structural Equation Modelling, Multi-Level Modelling, and Meta-Analysis for Master's students at Sussex.

Jenny's PhD combines her enthusiasm for improving research methods in psychology with her substantive interests in statistics education by exploring the discriminant validity of statistics anxiety using a variety of psychometric and other quantitative methods, including a large, international, multi-lab study.

Jenny is the Founder and Director the [RoSE (Researchers in Statistics Education) Network](https://www.jennyterry.co.uk/rosenetwork/) (due for re-launch in November 2022) and is an incoming committee member on the British Psychological Society's Mathematical, Statistical, and Computing Psychology section.
