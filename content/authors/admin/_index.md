Jenny Terry (she/her) is a Lecturer in Psychological Methods and Doctoral Researcher in the [School of Psychology](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) at the University of Sussex.

Her PhD combines her enthusiasm for improving research methods in psychology with her substantive interests in statistics education by exploring the construct validity of statistics anxiety using a variety of psychometric and other quantitative methods.

She also consults on psychometric scale development and provides statistical software training in R/SPSS to non-academic clients.

Jenny is the Chair of the British Psychological Society's postgraduate group, [PsyPAG](https://www.bps.org.uk/member-microsites/psypag) (2021-2023), postgraduate representative for the BPS's Mathematical, Statistical, and Computing Psychology section (2020-2022), and is the founder of the [RoSE (Researchers in Statistics Education) Network](https://www.jennyterry.co.uk/rosenetwork/).
